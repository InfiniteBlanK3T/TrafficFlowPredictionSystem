# Traffic Flow Prediction System (TFPS)

This project implements a traffic flow prediction system using machine learning techniques 
COS30018-Intelligent Systems - Semester 2 2024

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Either you can run with Docker or using Python virtual environment:
### Python virtual environment:
Bash file I have created to automate the set up the environment and downloading requirements files - this will create `.venv` your virtual Python environment
```bash
./init.sh

## Eventhough the script will automatically start your virtual env for you
## If there is any issue run this first at your <root>
source .venv/bin/activate
```
---------------------(__OR__)---------------------
### Docker Container:
- With this you will need this [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Making sure that you have installed it properly and running in the background before moving into next step
- Run this command in your Shell it will automatically setting up container for you.
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
